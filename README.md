# SuperMartManagementSystem
<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>
SuperMarts provides almost all the goods of daily and regular needs to the consumers under one roof. Thus, they do not have to move from one place to another to make their purchases. 
This project is a digital mart system that helps us to keep a checking balance, all the stockâ€™s sales and purchases, the customer purchase record, the employees and managerial data, and the billing features related to the customer.
<h3><b>Working:</b></h3>
Firstly, we have the start menu of our mart management system which has two features or views i.e., Admin and Customer. In the Admin view, we have different managerial operations such as adding, updating, removing items, and stock & customer details. The admin can make changes and view reports of the system. In the Customer view, the customer can purchase the item(s), view his cart, or change it and get his total calculated bill.
